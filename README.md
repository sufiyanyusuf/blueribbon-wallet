# Consumer facing mobile app / B2B2C marketplace for Blueribbon.io

(Blueribbon.io was a startup I started building during fall of 2019, to help businesses sell products and services as subscriptions).

I started building the app a little while after I'd started building the business facing dashboard. 
This app 
- Fetches listings created from the business dashboard
- Lets a user subscribe to a product from a business, 
- Pay using Apple pay
- Manage subscription, deliveries & renewals throughout the lifecycle

Built using React Native. 
Tinkering with animations was fun along the way. Ensuring cross platform compatibility was a nightmare.
