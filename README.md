# Consumer facing mobile app / B2B2C marketplace for Blueribbon.io

(Blueribbon.io was a startup I started building during fall of 2019, to help businesses sell products and services as subscriptions).

I started building the app a little while after I'd started building the business facing dashboard. This app fetches listings created from the business dashboard, and lets a user subscribe to a product from a business using Apple pay. 

Built using React Native. Tinkering with animations was fun along the way...
